Grade: B

You've used KLEE to verify two small programs: a lexical analyzer and
a tic-tac-toe game. These programs are under 200 lines of code and not
widely used, so it's not surprising that you might find issues in
them. I was hoping that you would work with more sophisticated
benchmarks. Your writeup is reasonably complete.
