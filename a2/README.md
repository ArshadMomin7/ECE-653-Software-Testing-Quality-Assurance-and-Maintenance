1. Computed the number of execution path by condition statement (True/False) and identified the test case by Symbolic execution method. 
2. Verified validity of FOL (First order Logic).
3. Implementation of a parser and interpreter for the WHILE language inlcuding symbolic execution with and without if-else case and while - statements.
